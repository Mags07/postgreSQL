# Seafood Brasserie

Seafood Brasserie is a restaurant on the coast of Cork, Ireland. They market themselves as the leaders of fresh seafood restaurant for dinner in their area.

The website provides basic information about the high class restaurant for ease of use. With the About section and Menu on one page. With the call to action to book button at the top and at the end of the page. The booking system is on the 2nd page and will allow people to see the available times for a dinner sitting, the dates the restaurant is open, the amount of people they can book for, special requests such as a birthday candle in dessert, and terms and conditions. Terms and conditions such as "You have the table for 2 hours" and "Incase of no-show the table will be given away after 20 minutes." etc.

The owner wanted the website to offer a quick view of the restaurant menu and ease of booking online, to reduce phone calls to the restuarant. This will help people to not get dissapointed if they show up without a booking also.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
